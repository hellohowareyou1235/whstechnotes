Over winter break I used technology in many ways. For example one way I used technology was watching movies and tv shows.

Autcraft was created as an online safe space for autistic children and their families.
The problem Autcraft was solving was bullying harassment and exclusion for autistic children and their families. Autcraft uses clear rules active moderation and a strong community culture to allow players to be themselves online and feel comfortable. If moderators and developers ignore safety and inclusion it will lead to more bullying and exclusion. Moderators and developers choices can affect the user expierience by adding a reporting system establishing easy and clear rules.

One way technology can promote fairness is by giving more access to services such as mobile apps for easier access to education, financial services, and healthcare. 
This technology matters because some people cannot get education, financical services, and healthcare easily. Technology allows people to get these services much easier while being cheaper to access. An example of this could be someone might need medical services but cannot go out to a place to get those medical services but they cand get someone to help them get to those places or get those same medical services at home using technology. In conclusion, using technology is important in many ways and can help create fairness and help people.
